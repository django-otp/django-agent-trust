This project has tools for managing trusted user agents. For example, you might
allow the user to indicate whether they are using a public or private computer
and implement different policies for each. This uses Django 1.4's signed cookie
facility and works independently of sessions.

Short list of features:

    - ``request.agent.is_trusted`` tells you whether the request came from a
      trusted agent.
    - APIs to trust or revoke the agent that made a given request.
    - Global and per-user settings can set the duration of agent trust as well
      as an inactivity timeout.
    - Revoke all of a user's previously trusted agents at any time.

..  The mechanisms by which a user is allowed to designate trusted agents is left
    entirely to clients of this library. For an application of this API using
    one-time passwords, see `django-otp-agents
    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-otp-agents>`_, part of the `django-otp
    <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-otp>`_ suite.
